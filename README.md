# Dune-Convex-Tracker
Tracks Convex cryptocurrency ownership shares by DAOs (companies)

## Overview

This is a rebuild of a website I helped design and implement, DAOCVX.com in order to practice my SQL.

The website tracks the amount of Convex (CVX) ownership by organizations in the cryptocurrency space. This is one of the first cryptocurrency projects (outside of ETH and BTC) that has seen this level of demand, so we decided to track it and build it as a resource for other cryptocurrency investors.

## Work In Progress

This project is incomplete. Below is a rough outline of what I'd like the final dashboard to display:

* CVX Stats
** Total / FDV
** Circ / Mcap
% staked, % locked
% circ owned by DAOs
Total CVX holdings per DAO over time
Wallet, Staked, vlCVX
With and without total included (or maybe different scale?)
Total CVX holdings vs # of DAOs invested
Remove unstaked/completely sold
CVX sells per DAO over time
Individual Sections per DAO
CVX accum over time (3 types separated)
7/30 day change
AVG cost basis per DAO
CVX mcap vs. protocol mcap
Most recent sells / buys
